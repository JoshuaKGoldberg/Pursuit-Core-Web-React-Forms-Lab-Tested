## Functionality

Build a React app containing:

- An input where the user can enter the values in an array
- A select to choose between calculating the sum, the average, and the [mode](https://www.mathsisfun.com/definitions/mode.html) _(most frequently occurring number)_
- A calculate button

## Getting Started

- Fork this repo
- Clone the forked repository
- `cd` to the directory where you cloned it
- `npm install` to install dependencies
- `npm run cypress` to open the cypress testing window
- `npm test` to run jest / node tests

> _Note_: Remember to `git add`, `git commit` and `git push` regularly

## Submission Guidelines

- When finished, commit and push your work.
- Make a pull request on github.
- Submit the link to your pull request on Canvas.

## Bonus

- Change the select input to show all three elements at once using `size`, and allow selecting `multiple`.
- When the button is pressed, print each selected operation onto the screen on a new line, like _`Sum: 35`_.
